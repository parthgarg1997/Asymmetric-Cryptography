this is the implementation of four kinds of cryptography
1) RSA
2) Diffie hellman key exchange
3) Elgamal
4) Elliptical curve cryptography

There are two part in each packages, 1 for encrypting the message and other for decrypting the message
person using these programs should open both programs and follow the steps and copy paste the codes 

thank you all.
